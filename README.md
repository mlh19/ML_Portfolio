## Other Details

* Worked on the majority of this assignment independently. Did however, reach out to my peer Damien Luzzo, TA's, Instructor, and tutor for additional help on CSS formatting.

* Used Google, W3 schools, and other resources from our class chats for help with formatting CSS.

* Misread the README instructions and did not use media queries in the beginning. When I attempted to build the media queries it messed up my original website format. I sought help from TA Christian who was unable to help me reslove the issue regarding media queries but did help with better desktop formatting. Additionally, I asked my tuor who was also unable to guide me to a solution. My instructor Leah suggested it could be a chrome browser issue however everything was updated and operating sufficiently.
